    Volume Spread Analysis (VSA) is a technical analysis technique used to identify market trends and patterns by analyzing the relationship between volume and price movements. VSA is based on the idea that volume precedes price movement, and by analyzing volume, traders can gain valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements.
