    Applied Research Scientist 
    As a child, I dreamed of becoming a cricketer or an astronaut, but growing up in a lower middle-class family, I soon faced the harsh realities of life. I scaled down my ambitions and set my sights on becoming a primary school teacher, with a modest salary of â‚¹12,000/month. However, fate had other plans, and an injury crushed my cricketing aspirations.

    Until the 8th grade, I was an unenthusiastic student, believing that academic success wouldn't guarantee a bright future. But everything changed when I discovered my passion for mathematics, particularly geometry, and solving Olympiad problems, inspired by my brilliant friend Soumendu.

    From that moment on, I began my journey, and I'm still amazed at how far I've come. My story is one of perseverance, self-discovery, and the power of embracing one's true potential."

    I believe I don't have much natural brainpower, but I've learned to compensate for it with sheer hard work. I firmly believe that anyone can compensate for intelligence with hard work.

I am confident that I can make a positive change, even if it's only for a small percentage of our population.
